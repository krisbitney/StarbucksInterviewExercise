# Starbucks Interview Exercise
This exercise and data was originally used as a take-home assignment provided by Starbucks for their job candidates. 

Starbucks ran an A/B test (randomized trial) evaluating the effect of a promotion. They found the promotion increased the likelihood a customer would make a purchase by about 1 percentage point, but because the promotion costs $0.15 per customer the experiment had a net loss $2,335 in revenue. The task is to use the A/B test data to improve targeting for the promotion and make it profitable. I achieved a positive net revenue of $225 in the test dataset.
